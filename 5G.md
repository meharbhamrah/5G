6. **Power Conservation:** Power conservation and protocol simplicity take precedence in mMTC. The focus is on enabling devices with lower data requirements and keeping device complexity and costs to a minimum. This approach is well-suited for applications like utility meters and simple sensors.

### **Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)**
7. **Fundamental Tenet:** URLLC, or Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, is designed to cater to applications that demand highly reliable and ultra-low latency communication links. These applications include mission-critical services such as military, first responders, law enforcement, as well as areas like remote healthcare, robotic surgery, secure financial transactions, and real-time manufacturing.
8. **Priorities:** URLLC prioritizes minimizing end-to-end latency and ensuring high reliability and availability. The goal is to provide extremely reliable and available performance, reaching up to five nines or six nines reliability levels, where even fractions of a second can make a significant difference in critical scenarios.
9. **Mobility:** URLLC applications often involve mobility, such as first responders or law enforcement officers who require reliable communication while on the move, including at high speeds. To achieve this, legacy protocols are reengineered to ensure consistent, low-latency, and highly reliable performance.

## **5G Network Architecture and Deployment Options**

In this summary, we'll explore 5G network architecture, deployment options, and key techniques that enable 5G networks to deliver on their promises.

### **5G Network Architecture**

- A general 5G network consists of user equipment (UE), 5G RAN (Radio Access Network), and the 5G core network (Next Generation Core or NGC).
- The UE represents the user's device, and the data network hosts services like email, web browsing, and video streaming.
- 5G RAN is composed of gNode-Bs, serving as base stations, providing wireless connectivity to UEs.
- The 5G core network comprises essential components, including the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), and User Plane Function (UPF).
- These components work together to enable 5G connectivity, with AMF handling user access, SMF managing sessions, and UPF facilitating data transmission.

### **Deployment Options: Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA)**
- **Standalone Option (SA):** A full-fledged 5G network where 5G technology operates end-to-end, involving 5G core network upgrades, 5G RAN deployment, and 5G spectrum acquisition. A long-term goal for operators.
- **Non-Standalone Option (NSA):** NSA networks use the existing 4G LTE core network and selectively deploy 5G base stations in high-capacity demand areas. Dual-connectivity-capable phones utilize both LTE and 5G channels simultaneously to address capacity challenges. NSA networks are a stepping stone towards SA networks.

### **Why Non-Standalone Is "Non-Standalone"**
- In NSA networks, 5G technology is not end-to-end; it is limited to the wireless channel. The core network remains 4G. It is called "non-standalone" because 5G connectivity relies on the existing 4G core network for end-to-end communication.

### **Benefits of NSA Networks**
- NSA networks are cost-effective and quicker to deploy compared to SA networks.
- They provide a practical solution for addressing capacity challenges in high-demand areas, serving as an interim solution as operators work towards full 5G implementation.

## **Key Techniques Enabling 5G Performance**
- **eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband):** Focuses on higher data speeds, spectral efficiency, and throughput. Ideal for applications requiring high throughput, such as cloud computing, real-time video streaming, and gaming.
- **mMTC (Massive Machine Type Communications):** Connects various devices or "Internet of Things" (IoT) devices that do not require high data rates. It emphasizes power conservation and simplicity of protocols to support a massive number of low-data-rate devices.
- **URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications):** Prioritizes low latency and high reliability, crucial for mission-critical services like military, first responders, and applications where real-time data is vital.
- 5G networks aim to offer a balance between data speeds, power efficiency, latency, reliability, and coverage, catering to diverse applications and use cases.
